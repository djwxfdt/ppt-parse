 * This element specifies a text field which contains generated text that the application should update periodically. Each piece of text when it is generated is given a unique identification number that is used to refer to a specific field. At the time of creation the text field is also specified to be of a certain type which indicates the type of text that should be used to update this field. This update type is used so that all applications that did not create this text field may still know what type of text it should be updated with. Thus the new application can then attach an update type to the text field id for continual updating.
